# ai-speech-translator

AI-powered OTT-style speech-to-speech translation system supporting audio, video, microphone, and YouTube URL inputs with multilingual translation, subtitles, and TTS output.

\# AI Speech Translator 🌍🎧



An AI-powered speech translation system that converts speech from one language

to another using automatic speech recognition, neural machine translation,

and text-to-speech synthesis.



This project supports both \*\*audio and video inputs\*\* and enables seamless

multilingual communication.

\## 🚀 Project Overview



The AI Speech Translator is designed to help users communicate across

languages in real time. The system detects the spoken language automatically,

converts speech to text, translates the text into a target language, and

generates natural-sounding speech output.

\## 🔁 4-Step Translation Pipeline



\### 1️⃣ Speech Input (Whisper)

\- Captures live or uploaded audio

\- Automatically detects the spoken language

\- Uses Whisper for accurate speech recognition



\### 2️⃣ Speech to Text (Whisper STT)

\- Converts speech into written text

\- Handles accents, background noise, and multiple languages

\- Produces clean and accurate transcripts



\### 3️⃣ Text Translation (NMT APIs)

\- Translated using Neural Machine Translation APIs

\- Supports multiple global languages

\- Scalable and cloud-friendly



\### 4️⃣ Text to Speech (TTS)

\- Converts translated text back to speech

\- Produces natural and human-like audio output

\- Enables real-time communication
